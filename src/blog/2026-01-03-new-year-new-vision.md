The holidays have come and gone, and we're stepping into 2026 with fresh energy and big plans.

## We've Been Busy

While things may have seemed quiet on the surface, the team has been hard at work behind the scenes. The holiday break gave us time to rest, reflect, and dream — but it also gave us time to plan. We've been brainstorming, refining our roadmap, designing systems, and preparing to make some serious progress on everything we've been building toward.

Now that the team is all back from the holidays, we're hitting the ground running. Development officially kicks off this month, and we have a clear runway ahead of us.

## Multiple Projects in the Works

We're not just building one game — we're building a studio. That means thinking bigger and laying the groundwork for multiple experiences that all share our commitment to quality and faith-driven storytelling. Here's a glimpse at what's in development:

### The Scripture Journey

Our flagship project. An ambitious RPG that takes players through the entire biblical narrative, from Genesis to Revelation.

### 
Letters to the Underground



Letters to the Underground is a survival stealth game set in first-century Rome during Nero's persecution of Christians. You lead an underground church, managing a network of believers while navigating impossible moral choices, smuggling scripture, and evading Roman authorities. Every decision carries weight, every believer has a story, and faithfulness may cost you everything. Features asymmetric multiplayer where a second player can infiltrate your community as a Roman informant.


### 
Children of the Exodus




Children of the Exodus is a grand strategy survival game that places you in command of the Israelite exodus from Egypt to Canaan. Manage two million people across twelve tribes, navigate resource scarcity and tribal politics, and shepherd a nation through forty years of desert wandering. Faith is not a resource to be optimized but a living reality that rises and falls based on your leadership. Features competitive multiplayer where two players lead rival tribal coalitions with hidden agendas.

## 
Rekindled



Rekindled is a metroidvania action RPG set in the kingdom of Auros, a land consumed by a spiritual corruption called the Hollow. You are a Keeper, one of the last who carries an inner flame capable of rekindling what has been emptied. Explore an interconnected world that responds to your light, master abilities tied to spiritual disciplines like stillness, sacrifice, and truth-speaking, and fight back against a darkness that does not attack but simply invites surrender.

### 
Settlers of Conviction



Settlers of Conviction is a colony builder where your principles shape your community. Establish a settlement on an unforgiving frontier and decide how you will handle justice, distribute resources, treat outsiders, and respond to failure. These are not cosmetic choices but mechanical systems with real consequences. Every precedent you set becomes culture, and culture determines whether your community thrives or fractures when the hard times come. Features cooperative and competitive multiplayer where neighboring settlements with different founding principles must navigate coexistence.

## The Studio is Officially Launching

January 2026 marks the full release of Seventh Day Studios as an official, operational game development studio. This isn't just a side project anymore. We're going all in.

## Thank You

To everyone who's been following along, joined our Discord, or simply believed in what we're building — thank you. 2026 is going to be a year of action, growth, and big moves.
