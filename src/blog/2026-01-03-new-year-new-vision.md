The holidays have come and gone, and we're stepping into 2026 with fresh energy and big plans.

## We've Been Busy

While things may have seemed quiet on the surface, the team has been hard at work behind the scenes. The holiday break gave us time to rest, reflect, and dream — but it also gave us time to plan. We've been brainstorming, refining our roadmap, designing systems, and preparing to make some serious progress on everything we've been building toward.

Now that the team is all back from the holidays, we're hitting the ground running. Development officially kicks off this month, and we have a clear runway ahead of us.

## Multiple Projects in the Works

We're not just building one game — we're building a studio. That means thinking bigger and laying the groundwork for multiple experiences that all share our commitment to quality and faith-driven storytelling. Here's a glimpse at what's in development:

### The Scripture Journey

Our flagship project. An ambitious RPG that takes players through the entire biblical narrative, from Genesis to Revelation.

### The Way

A survival stealth game set in first-century Rome during Nero's persecution.

### Wilderness

A grand strategy survival game commanding the Israelite exodus from Egypt to Canaan.

### Ember

A metroidvania action RPG set in the kingdom of Auros, consumed by a spiritual corruption called the Hollow.

### Foundation

A colony builder where your principles shape your community.

## The Studio is Officially Launching

January 2026 marks the full release of Seventh Day Studios as an official, operational game development studio. This isn't just a side project anymore. We're going all in.

## Thank You

To everyone who's been following along, joined our Discord, or simply believed in what we're building — thank you. 2026 is going to be a year of action, growth, and big moves.
