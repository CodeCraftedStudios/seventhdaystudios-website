As a 17-year-old self-taught developer, I've been asked more than once why I'm attempting something this ambitious. The Scripture Journey isn't just another game—it's an epic RPG that will take players through the entire Bible, from Genesis to Revelation. That's over 66 books of Scripture, transformed into interactive, immersive gameplay.

The answer is simple: because it needs to exist.

## The Gap in Christian Gaming

Look at the current landscape of Christian games. Most fall into one of two categories: either they're simple Sunday school apps with basic trivia, or they're vaguely "faith-inspired" games that water down the message to appeal to mainstream audiences.

Where are the games that treat Scripture with the same level of care, artistry, and production value that secular studios bring to their mythology-based RPGs? Where are the games that let you walk through the parting of the Red Sea, stand with Daniel in the lion's den, or experience the resurrection?

They don't exist. Not really. Not at the level they should.

## Why Roblox?

I get this question a lot. Why build on Roblox instead of Unity or Unreal?

First, accessibility. Roblox has over 70 million daily active users, many of them young people who might never pick up a "Christian game" on Steam. By meeting players where they already are, we can reach audiences that traditional Christian game studios never could.

Second, the platform has matured significantly. Modern Roblox supports advanced graphics, complex scripting, and immersive experiences that rival standalone games. The days of blocky, simple games are behind us.

Third, community. Roblox's social features mean players can experience The Scripture Journey together, discuss what they're learning, and build genuine connections around shared faith.

## What Makes This Different

The Scripture Journey isn't a game that preaches at you. It's a game that invites you into the story.

You won't just read about David facing Goliath—you'll feel the weight of those stones in your hand. You won't just learn about Paul's shipwreck—you'll fight to survive the storm. Every major biblical event becomes an interactive experience that engages players emotionally, intellectually, and spiritually.

Key features include:

- **Biblical accuracy** as a non-negotiable priority, with every story verified against Scripture
- **Advanced scripting** in Lua for complex game mechanics, AI behavior, dialogue systems, and seamless transitions between gameplay and cutscenes
- **Optimized assets** that look incredible while still running smoothly on lower-end devices
- **Original music and sound design** that captures the emotional weight of each biblical moment
- **Modular design** allowing for updates, expansions, and community feedback integration

Is it ambitious for one self-taught 17-year-old? Absolutely. But I serve a God who specializes in doing the impossible through unlikely people. David was a shepherd boy. Gideon was the weakest in his family. And I'm just a teenager with a laptop and a calling.

## The Road Ahead

The Scripture Journey is currently in early development. I'm starting with the foundational systems—the core gameplay mechanics, the UI framework, and the first playable sections. Genesis will be the first "book" completed, serving as both a proof of concept and the beginning of this epic journey.

This is a massive undertaking, and I won't pretend it's going to happen overnight. But every great journey starts with a single step. Or in this case, a single line of code.

## Final Thoughts

The Scripture Journey isn't just a game I'm making—it's a calling I'm answering. I believe that interactive media has incredible power to communicate truth, and I believe that Christian creators need to step up and make content that honors God while genuinely engaging people.

I'm not waiting until I'm older, until I have more experience, or until someone gives me permission. I'm starting now, with what I have, trusting that God will multiply my efforts like He multiplied the loaves and fish.

Thank you for reading, and thank you for being part of this journey. Whether you're a fellow believer, a curious gamer, or someone who just stumbled across this blog—I'm glad you're here.

The best is yet to come.
