## **We've Been Busy**


While things may have seemed quiet on the surface, the team has been hard at work behind the scenes. The holiday break gave us time to rest, reflect, and dream — but it also gave us time to plan. We've been writing design documents, refining our vision, building systems, and preparing to make serious progress on everything we've been working toward.


Now that we're back from the holidays, we're hitting the ground running. Development officially kicks off this month, and we have a clear runway ahead of us.

## Our Flagship Project

We're excited to officially announce our primary focus for 2026: **The Pilgrim's Progress.**

## The Pilgrim's Progress

An action-adventure adaptation of John Bunyan's timeless allegory, brought to life like never before.


Journey as Christian, a man burdened by the weight of his sin, fleeing the City of Destruction toward the Celestial City. Battle demonic forces in visceral, souls-inspired combat. Traverse landscapes from the Slough of Despond to the Valley of the Shadow of Death. Stand against Apollyon. Endure the trials of Vanity Fair. And experience one of literature's greatest stories through gameplay that honors its source.

## What We're Building:

**20+ hours** of narrative-driven gameplay


**God of War-inspired combat** with the Armor of God as your arsenal


**Red Dead Redemption 2-style exploration** through a world that feels lived-in and dangerous


**Faithful adaptation** that respects Bunyan's vision while making it accessible to modern players


**PC platform** built in Unity, with quality as the foundation

This isn't a surface-level adaptation. We've spent months developing a comprehensive story bible, detailed combat systems, and character designs that bring every pilgrim, guide, and demon to life. The design documentation alone spans over a hundred pages — because we believe the details matter.

## Why This Story?

The Pilgrim's Progress has been translated into over 200 languages and has never been out of print since 1678. It's one of the most influential books in history, and yet it's never received a game adaptation that matches its significance.


We believe this story deserves better. Christian's journey from the City of Destruction to the Celestial City is one of the most powerful narratives ever written — a story of struggle, failure, perseverance, and ultimate hope. It's a story that resonates across centuries because it speaks to something universal in the human experience.


And we believe it can be an incredible game.

## The Studio is Officially Launching

January 2026 marks the full launch of Seventh Day Studios as an official, operational game development studio. This isn't just a side project anymore. We're going all in.


That means our brand presence is solidifying, we're establishing the infrastructure to support long-term development, and we're building a team of passionate creators who share our vision. This is the month everything becomes real.

## Our Vision: Quality Over Compromise

When Seventh Day Studios first started taking shape, it began with a simple observation: the gaming world needs more faith-driven content that doesn't compromise on quality. That vision hasn't changed — if anything, it's grown stronger.


We've built our studio on three pillars:


**Faith-Driven Purpose.** Every game we create exists to glorify God and impact players. We're not adding faith as an afterthought — it's the foundation everything else is built on.


**Uncompromising Quality.** We refuse to hide behind the "Christian game" label as an excuse for mediocrity. If a mechanic isn't fun, we fix it. If a story beat doesn't land, we rewrite it. Our games will stand alongside the best in the industry — not beneath them.


**Quality Over Compromise.** We're not rushing to push something out just to say we did it. We're not cutting corners to hit arbitrary deadlines. We're committed to building games that actually matter and stand the test of time. That means being intentional with every decision, taking feedback seriously, and putting in the work even when no one's watching.


We're not here to make generic "Christian games" that feel like an afterthought. We're here to create experiences that are genuinely fun, deeply meaningful, and built with the same level of care and polish you'd expect from any top-tier studio.

## What's Next


Over the coming months, you'll see The Pilgrim's Progress take shape. We'll be sharing concept art, development updates, and behind-the-scenes looks at the creative process. We'll be talking about combat design, level design, and how we're translating 17th-century allegory into interactive experience.


And we'll be looking for collaborators. If you're an artist, programmer, composer, or designer who resonates with this vision — stay tuned. We'll have more to share soon about how you can be part of this journey.

## Thank You

To everyone who's been following along, joined our Discord, or simply believed in what we're building — thank you. Seriously. This journey wouldn't be the same without you, and we don't take that for granted.


2026 is going to be a year of action, growth, and big moves. We can feel it.
